# Intro

This project started with the idea to improve the well known Gaggia Classic. Inspired by [Decent Espresso](https://decentespresso.com) and other Arduino coffee projects I tried to develop my version of a "Decent" Gaggia Classic with an Arduino board. The initial prototype has a PID using an Arduino. Further development shall lead to pressure profiling and saving multiple shot profiles.
